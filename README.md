Create Datadog Notify Event




## Introduction

This repository contains the action for sending an event to datadog.




## Usage

Minimal Usage:
```yaml
- name: Notify Datadog
  uses: cloudposse/github-action-datadog-notify@main
  with:
    api_key: ## ${{ env.DATADOG_API_KEY }} ## ${{secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY}}
    title: "GitHub Action: ${{ github.event_name }}"
    text: "GitHub Action: ${{ github.event_name }}"
    tags: "source:github,repo:${{ github.repository }},event:${{ github.event_name }}"
    alert_type: "info"
```

Below is a snippet that will send an event to datadog when a pull request is sync'd.
Below uses the `dkershner6/aws-ssm-getparameters-action` to get the datadog api key from ssm.

```yaml
name: Datadog Notify
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - 'main'

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  datadog-notify:
    runs-on: ["self-hosted"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        id: aws-credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          role-to-assume:  ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME }}
          role-session-name: "gha-datadog-notify"
          aws-region: "us-east-1"

      - uses: dkershner6/aws-ssm-getparameters-action@v1
        with:
          parameterPairs: "/datadog/datadog_api_key = DATADOG_API_KEY"

      - name: Notify Datadog
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-datadog-notify@main
        with:
          api_key: ${{ env.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
          title: "GitHub Action: ${{ github.event_name }}"
          text: "GitHub Action: ${{ github.event_name }}"
          tags: "source:github,repo:${{ github.repository }},event:${{ github.event_name }}"
          alert_type: "info"
```
